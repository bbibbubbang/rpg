# HTML RPG Movement Demo

This repository contains simple movement demos implemented with HTML5 and JavaScript.

## Playing

- The `android-webview` folder includes an example HTML page for touch input and a `MainActivity.kt` that loads it in an Android WebView.

## Controls

- `q`: Quit the game in environments that support it.
