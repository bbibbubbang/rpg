# HTML RPG Movement Demo

This repository contains simple movement demos implemented with HTML5 and JavaScript.

## Playing

- Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to try the pseudo-3D canvas demo.
- The `android-webview` folder includes an example HTML page for touch input and a `MainActivity.kt` that loads it in an Android WebView.
- A test NPC is rendered using a canvas-based sprite to demonstrate image-style characters without external files.

## Controls

- Arrow keys or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`: Move the player.
- `q`: Quit the game in environments that support it.
